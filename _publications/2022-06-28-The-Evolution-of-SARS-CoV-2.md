Species evolve over time and viruses are no exception. Extensive genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the global
pandemic has allowed for highly detailed and invaluable characterization of the molecular evolution in a virus
population, to an extent that has never been seen before. Tracking of the molecular evolutionary changes in SARS-CoV-2
allows for (1) inference of important local and global transmission routes by tracking the distribution of specific
genotypes, (2) identification of adaptive evolutionary changes with potential human health implications, and (3)
generation of expectations/predictions for future evolutionary changes to better tailor detection, mitigation, and
treatment strategies. In this chapter, we begin by outlining the key processes driving evolution in viruses, namely,
random genetic drift and natural selection. We summarize the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 within the context of
other coronavirus species. Then we explore how ongoing genomic and epidemiological patterns have been used to identify
the extent to which natural selection has played a role in the evolution of SAR-CoV-2 throughout the global pandemic.
Next, an outline is provided for the World Health Organizationâ€™s criteria for identifying evolved Variants of Concern (
VOC), along with a discussion about the impact of these evolved VOCs on human health. Finally, mechanisms are identified
for extensive and rapid adaptive evolution in SARS-CoV-2 which suggest the need for closer monitoring. In addition, the
possibilities for future evolution in SARS-CoV-2 are mentioned.
