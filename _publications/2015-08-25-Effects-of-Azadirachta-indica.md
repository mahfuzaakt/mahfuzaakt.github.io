Microorganisms tend to develop antibiotic resistance more rapidly within biofilm than their planktonic counterparts.
Search for novel natural compounds that may suppress biofilm growth without killing the microorganisms might act against
biofilm mediated resistance. Recently different plant produced compounds were shown to antagonize biofilm formation to
some extent. In this study, antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of 6 extracts in different organic and inorganic
solvents from three medicinal plants Azadirachta indica (neem), Allium cepa (onion), Ocimum tenuiflorum (tulsi) were
tested. Disk diffusion assay was used to determine microbial growth inhibition and tube dilution method was used to
determine the minimum inhibitory concentration. Among all the extracts, only ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A.
indica exhibited antibacterial activity. However, all of the extracts inhibited biofilm, among which raw extract of O.
tenuiflorum exhibited the most biofilm inhibition (86.56%) property. In addition, raw extract of A. indica, O.
tenuiflorum and A. cepa degraded already formed biofilm by 64.01%, 52.81% and 31.09% respectively. The results of the
present study suggest that A. indica, O. tenuiflorum and A. cepa can be potential sources for developing potential
anti-biofilm compunds.
