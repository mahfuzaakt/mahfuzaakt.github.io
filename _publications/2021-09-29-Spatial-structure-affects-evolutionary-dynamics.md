Most populations live in spatially structured environments and that structure has the potential
to impact the evolutionary dynamics in a number of important ways. Theoretical models tracking
evolution in structured environments using a range of different approaches, suggest that local
interactions and spatial heterogeneity can increase the adaptive benefits of motility, impact both
the rate and extent of adaptation, and increase the probability of parallel evolution. We test
these general predictions in a microbial evolution experiment tracking phenotypic and genomic
changes in replicate populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens evolved in both well-mixed and
spatially-structured environments, where spatial structure was generated through the addition
of semi-solid agar. In contrast to the well-mixed environment, populations evolved in the
spatially-structured environment adapted more slowly, retained the ability to disperse more
rapidly, and had a greater putatively neutral population genomic diversity. The degree of parallel
evolution measured at the gene-level, did not differ across these two types of experimental
environments, perhaps because the populations had not evolved for long enough to near their
fitness optima. These results confirm important general impacts of spatial structure on
evolutionary dynamics at both the phenotypic and genomic level.
